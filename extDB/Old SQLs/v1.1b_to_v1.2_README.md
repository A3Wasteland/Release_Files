Update instructions for A3W v1.2
================================

### extDB2 migration

  1. Delete your existing extDB libraries (Windows: extDB.dll, tbb.dll, tbbmalloc.dll / Linux: extDB.so)
  2. Rename "extdb-conf.ini" to something like "extdb-conf_old.ini"
  3. In the "extDB" folder from the Arma 3 root, rename the "db_custom" folder to "sql_custom_v2", and delete the "a3wasteland.ini" located inside; do NOT rename "extDB"
  4. Put the new extDB2 libraries (Windows: extDB2.dll / Linux: extDB2.so) and the new extdb-conf.ini in the Arma 3 root
  5. Put the new "a3wasteland.ini" in the aforementioned "sql_custom_v2" folder
  6. Open the new "extdb-conf.ini" in a text editor, and adjust the connection settings in the [A3W] section at the bottom according to your previous settings from "extdb-conf_old.ini"

That's it. You don't really to use -mod with an "@extDB" folder, putting the libraries alongside arma3server.exe is sufficient. Also, if you plan on collecting debug info for me or Torndeco, you should keep the extDB2 debug libraries ready in a separate folder, so that you can easily swap them out with the regular ones if needed.
